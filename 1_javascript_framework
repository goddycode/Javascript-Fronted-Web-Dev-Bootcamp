A JavaScript framework is a pre-written set of code that helps developers to build web applications more efficiently and with less manual coding. Frameworks provide a structured way to develop dynamic web applications by offering a foundation or structure for building a specific type of software.

There are several JavaScript frameworks available, each catering to different aspects of web development. Here are a few examples:

1. **Angular:** Developed by Google, Angular is a comprehensive front-end framework for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs). It uses TypeScript and provides features for two-way data binding, dependency injection, and modular development.

2. **React:** Developed by Facebook, React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is particularly popular for building UI components and is often used in combination with other libraries or frameworks to create complete applications.

3. **Vue.js:** Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library focuses on the view layer only, making it easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.

4. **Node.js:** While not a front-end framework, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It is commonly used for building scalable network applications.

5. **Express.js:** Built on top of Node.js, Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It facilitates the creation of server-side applications.

Frameworks often come with built-in functionalities, libraries, and conventions, which can help developers streamline the development process, reduce bugs, and improve maintainability. The choice of framework depends on the specific needs of the project, the developer's preference, and the requirements of the application being built.01~
