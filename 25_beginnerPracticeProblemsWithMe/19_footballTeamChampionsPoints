/*
Our football team team finshed the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship.Rules for counting points for each match:
if x>y-3points
if x<y-0points
if x=y-1point

Notes:
There are 10 matches in the championship
0<=x<=4
0<=y<=4
